# iMart (E-Commerce website)

An e-commerce website is a software system developed primarily to facilitate buying and selling of products between users.  

This website has primarily 3 stakeholders user, seller and site admin.


User guide is available [here](https://github.com/samarth1107/E-Commerce/blob/main/UserGuide.pdf)


### Users 
In this project, there are following categories of users: 
1.  Buyers 

A buyer is a free user of this service. A buyer will signup and login to the system to get access to a catalog of products. The products can belong to categories, and the user can search for specific products on the website.

A product will have at least two images, a name and a description. You can add additional information, if required.

A buyer can also purchase a product. To mimic a payment gateway, you can use stripe in test mode. It is easy to set up and allows transactions from a dummy card in dev mode. You can skip stripe integration if it gets too difficult, and create a simple CRUD based simple payment gateway as well.


2. Sellers
A seller will request the admin for approval of selling. The seller will have to upload a document (can be any pdf) and send it to the admin for approval. 
Once a seller has approval from the admin, they will be allowed to catalog products, set the inventory, add product details, and so on. 

3. Admin 

An admin can remove any suspicious buyers or sellers from the e-commerce system. They can approve seller applications after looking at the documents. They can add or remove any products listed by any seller.
